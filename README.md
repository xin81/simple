# simple
This "project" is rather a collection of different algorithms than one specific project.
So, it does not pursue any goal in particular. Most algorithms here (if not all of them)
are very basic ones which most of you already know.
When you need to look up an algorithm, feel free to copy and paste my source files.
However, keep in mind that most source codes have been developed on a linux machine.
So, there is no 100% guarantee for all souce files to work on a windows machine.

programming language: C
compiler: gcc-4.8
IDE: eclipse 3.8 (this should be not relevant for a successful compilation - feel free to use your own IDE)
operating system: Linux Mint 17.1 (64-Bit) (all source files should work on any linux machine)
