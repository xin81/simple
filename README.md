# simple
This "project" is rather a collection of different algorithms than one specific project.
So, it does not pursue any goal in particular. Most algorithms here (if not all of them)
are very simple basic ones which most of you already know.
When you need to look up an algorithm, feel free to copy and paste my source files.
When you use them, keep in mind that most source codes have been written on a linux machine.
So, there is no 100% guarantee for all souce files to work on a windows machine.
